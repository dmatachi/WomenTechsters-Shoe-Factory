This project was carried out to understand the shoe brands that experience high order fulfillment. 
First, the data collected in the first sheet was very unorganized and needed to be cleaned or transformed.
After cleaning and transforming the data using functions like split, replace, proper, and paste special operation (divide), the data became more understandable.
The shoe brands New Balance, Asics, Puma, and Armani have the highest fulfillment. 

However, Armani shoe brand order fulfillment is 102%, meaning it is available in stock and customer Kennedi Singh is super satisfied with his order.
Every other shoe brand with lower order fulfillment rate were out of stock at the moment of order processing. 

Finally, I advised the shoe factory to always estock raw material on-time for shoe brands that had lower fulfillment and focus more on shoe brands that always has great fulfillment because that is where the profit comes from.
